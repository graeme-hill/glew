## Summary

The only actual source file that matters is glew.c (and the headers it
includes). Normally that file and it's headers are not committed to the repo
because they are automatically generated by the `make extensions` command.
However, that command can only be run from linux so it's more convienient for
me to actually commit those source files. That means I never need to touch
this repo unless I want to update extensions or use new code generator.

## Changes

* Added auto-generated files to git repo and removed them from .gitignore
* Added root level CMakeLists that builds static library
